**The modern art**, created from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, emerged alongside major global changes like urbanization, industrialization, new technologies, and mass media. Artists from diverse backgrounds responded by experimenting with new styles, subjects, and materials. What was considered "modern" varied by time and place—some artists explored new ways to express reality and emotion, others blurred the lines between art and design, and many addressed social and political issues. Overall, modern artists redefined both how art looked and who it was for.

**Contemporary art** refers to artwork made **from 1980 to today**. While diverse in style and background, many contemporary artists address urgent global issues like political oppression, climate change, social inequality, and technology’s impact. They also challenge the nature of art itself by reusing existing materials, blending art with pop culture, and experimenting with new media like video, performance, and installation. Their work often sparks debate due to its provocative themes and unconventional forms.
