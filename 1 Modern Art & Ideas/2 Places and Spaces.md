## Places & Spaces

Exploring how environment shapes art through three artists and their iconic works:

- **Vincent van Gogh** created The Starry Night while in a mental asylum in St. Paul de Mausole, France. Despite his confinement, the expansive view from his window inspired a turbulent, expressive depiction of the night sky—reflecting his inner turmoil.
- **Piet Mondrian**, fleeing Nazi-occupied Paris, found new inspiration in New York City’s energy. At age 68, he embraced jazz and painted Broadway Boogie Woogie, a vibrant, abstract homage to the city’s dynamism.
- **Gordon Matta-Clark**, in decaying 1970s Niagara Falls, turned a condemned house into a conceptual artwork called Bingo. He cut the facade into nine squares, highlighting overlooked urban decay. Only a few pieces were preserved; the rest, like the house, was destroyed.

Together, these stories show that while art may end up in museums, it begins in deeply personal and physical places—shaped by the artist’s environment, experiences, and emotional states.

## How do artists choose to represent the world?

- **Hippolyte Blancard**, a pharmacist and amateur photographer, documented the construction of the Eiffel Tower from 1887 to 1889 through [platinum prints](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/platinum-print). His photographs captured the transformation of Paris during La Belle Époque—a time of modernization, innovation, and cultural growth. The Eiffel Tower, built for the 1889 World’s Fair, symbolized the city’s rapid change under Haussmann’s urban reforms. Blancard’s images reflect both the technological marvel of the tower and the mixed public reaction to Paris’s evolving landscape.

- Manhatta (1921), created by **Paul Strand** and **Charles Sheeler**, is regarded as the first American avant-garde film. Inspired by Walt Whitman’s poem [“Mannahatta”](https://poets.org/poem/mannahatta), the film uses 65 shots to depict a day in Lower Manhattan—from a morning ferry arrival to a sunset cityscape. Through dramatic camera angles, it captures the energy and movement of New York City as a modern, bustling metropolis.

- **Salvador Dalí**’s The Persistence of Memory combines surreal imagery with real-life inspiration. While the melting clocks and eerie figure appear dreamlike, the landscape is based on Dalí’s memories of Catalonia’s coast near Port Lligat. Using Surrealist techniques, he blended elements from his subconscious with real features like the cliffs of Cap de Creus, creating a scene rooted in both imagination and reality.

- **Leonora Carrington** discovered [Surrealism](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/surrealism) at 19 and quickly immersed herself in the art world, determined to be an artist rather than a muse. She later settled in Mexico City, where she explored mythology, mysticism, and healing. Her painting _And Then We Saw the Daughter of the Minotaur_ reflects these themes, portraying her children in a magical, symbolic scene. Throughout her 80-year career, Carrington remained devoted to uncovering life’s mysteries, embracing the unknown with curiosity and imagination.

- **Bernd and Hilla Becher** spent over 40 years documenting disappearing industrial architecture, such as water towers and blast furnaces, across Europe and the U.S. Using a large-format camera and black-and-white film, they photographed these structures with precision—frontally and under overcast skies. They organized the images into grids by function, highlighting subtle variations in design. Their work aimed to preserve and study the overlooked beauty of "anonymous architecture."

- **Jeff Wall**’s staged photograph is inspired by the prologue of Ralph Ellison’s _Invisible Man_, where the narrator describes living in a basement lit by 1,369 stolen lights. Rather than directly illustrating the text, Wall used elements from the novel and his imagination to create a visual interpretation of the scene. He often bases his work on chance moments, describing this image as an "accident" sparked by reading, rather than real-life observation.

## How do artists capture the mood of a place?

- **Vincent van Gogh**’s The Starry Night was inspired by the view from his asylum window in Saint-Rémy, where he stayed in 1889–90. The painting blends real observations with imagination, memory, and emotion. Elements like the Dutch-style church steeple reflect his past, while the swirling sky mirrors astronomical imagery. Van Gogh used bold brushstrokes and vivid contrasts to express his belief that the night was more vibrant and alive than the day.

- In his later years, **Claude Monet** created a series of large-scale paintings of the lily ponds in his Giverny garden, which was meticulously maintained by six gardeners. Through layered colors and brushstrokes, he aimed to capture the endless, shifting sensations of water, light, and reflection—immersing viewers in the natural beauty and atmosphere of the pond.

- **Piet Mondrian** moved to New York in 1940 to escape WWII and was inspired by the city's energy and boogie-woogie music. A leader of the [de Stijl](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/de-stijl) movement, he typically used straight lines and primary colors to create harmony. In Broadway Boogie Woogie, he broke his usual color bars into lively, multicolored blocks that mimic the rhythm of music and the movement of city traffic, while maintaining precise balance through careful color placement.

- **Edward Ruscha**’s 1966 artist’s book Every Building on the Sunset Strip is a 25-foot-long accordion-fold photocollage showing both sides of a mile-long stretch of Los Angeles’s Sunset Boulevard. Created using a motorized camera mounted on a pickup truck, the book captures the flat, horizontal character of the city as experienced by driving. Ruscha aimed to document the street exactly as it was, describing his approach as “copying something for what it is.”

## How do artists re-imagine architecture?

- **Gordon Matta-Clark** trained as an architect, repurposed condemned buildings into conceptual artworks. In economically declining Niagara Falls, NY, he was given 10 days to cut into a house before demolition. He sliced its façade into nine rectangles resembling a bingo card, resulting in eight fragments (MoMA holds three). The process was also filmed.

- **Bodys Isek Kingelez** from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, began creating intricate architectural models from paper and recycled materials after moving to Kinshasa. Motivated by civic ideals, he built imaginative structures reflecting his vision for a better world. His work U.N. was made to honor the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, emphasizing global peace and cooperation.
